This is a macro executed by autohotkey made by ai so might be a bit crappy, but it works for a farm. You are able to change the phaseDuration to how long it takes you to complete each layer. This macro holds w and a for a selected time and switches to w and d. I would reccommend using claude.ai if you would like to configure it to start with w and d.
I am only posting this because i couldnt find a macro that was super easy to set up for a melon farm.
Add 1puko on discord if you have any questions or would like me to create another macro with ai because you're too lazy to do it.
